    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    
    <h2>Learning the Client-Server Model</h2>
    <p>The client–server model is how websites work: the client asks, the server sends, and the client shows it on the screen.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Web Architecture</h3>
    <p>Web architecture is the basic structure of how a website works. It shows how the client (browser), server, and internet work together. When you open a website, the client sends a request, the server processes it, and then sends the webpage back to be shown on your screen.</p>

    <h2>Things I Learned in Web Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML Boilerplate</li>
        <li>Using Headings (h1 to h6) to structure content</li>
        <li>Creating lists </li>
        <li>Building forms to collect user input</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Input Form Section</h2>
    <form>
        <p>Enter your Name:</p>
        <input type="text" name="userName">

        <p>Enter your Age:</p>
        <input type="number" name="userAge">

        <p>Enter your Email:</p>
        <input type="email" name="userEmail">
    </form>

    <h2>Bonus: Why we need a server</h2>
    <p>We need a server to show websites on the internet because local files on our computer cannot be accessed by other people worldwide. A server is always online and has a public address, allowing anyone with the link to request and view the website files.</p>


    <h1>Part D: Output Preview</h1>
    <p>When this webpage is opened, it will display headings and paragraphs . It will show a placeholder image followed by a bulleted list of topics learned. Finally, it will display a simple form with three input boxes where users can type their name, age, and email address.</p>
